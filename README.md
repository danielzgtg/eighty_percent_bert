# eighty_percent_bert

This is a sandbox of mine for machine learning.
It started off as `./bert.py` to objectively investigate the answer to [a question on r/learnjapanese](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/uxr6zf/what_80_comprehension_feels_like/).
Then it evolved to me exploring the rest of the language transformers on HuggingFace.

Most of the files I only tested on the 27th of May, 2022.
On the 1st of November, 2022 I refactored the third-party copyrighted text into a separate folder.
I didn't even check if things still work because I'm only using the idea clustering feature for class now.

This project is visible-source, not open-source (yet).

This was a exploration project so the code is a mess.
The only reason I'm uploading this is because my PyCharm bug report is leaking the folder name.
I might change the license once I create a clean GUI for it, but that will probably be in a different repository.
